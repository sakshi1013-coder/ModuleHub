# ModuleHub 🚀  
### Open-Source Component Registry for Modern Teams

ModuleHub is a real-time open-source component registry designed to simplify dependency management and component tracking in large organizations. It provides a centralized platform to index internal packages, monitor version updates, and notify developers instantly about breaking changes or security vulnerabilities.
